Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Start XAMPP Services
Open the XAMPP Control Panel and start both Apache and MySQL services. These are essential for running the local server and managing the database.

2. Open Anaconda Prompt
Launch the Anaconda Prompt to access the Python environment where the required dependencies are already installed.

3. Navigate to the Project Directory
In the Anaconda Prompt, go to the folder where the project files are located.

4. Run the Project File
Execute the main Python file to start the backend server. This will also initiate connections to any necessary services.

5. Access the Application on Localhost
Once the server is up and running, open a web browser and visit the localhost address. The application should now be accessible from your local machine for testing and usage.
